# DomainSharedContactsEditor specifications #

**In general about specifications in this project must be said that they need not to be written just to have them.** But special in not so quite obvious program behaviors or implementations it is nice to have at least a _user story_ or some thoughts why something works like it works. Just for the future.

I also sometimes use the writing of specifications because they help me thinking about a problem.


Following you find links to existing _functional-_ and _technical specifications_ of the **DomainSharedContactsEditor.**

  * In this project  a _functional specification_ describes how a program or part of a program will work from user's perspective. It does not describe technological details, it describes features in a common, not technical language.
  * A _technical specification_ describes the internal implementation of the feature prior described by in the _technical specification_. So it talks about structures, models, design and implementation decisions and why they have been made etc.
