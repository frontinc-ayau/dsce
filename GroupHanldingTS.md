# About groups at Goolge #

Groups are described at [Google code](http://code.google.com/apis/contacts/docs/poco/1.0/developers_guide.html#AboutGroups) like follows:

> The Portable Contacts specification allows a Service Provider to provide named groups of contacts.

> Google Contacts defines four named "system groups" of contacts for each user:
  * Coworkers
  * Family
  * Friends
  * My Contacts
> A user can manually add contacts to the Coworkers, Family, and Friends groups; the My Contacts group contains contacts added to contact groups by the user.

> Note: System groups' names are not guaranteed to be localized, so in general you're responsible for presenting the system groups in a way appropriate for your users, such as by providing localized names for the system groups, or representing them using icons.

<font color='#900000'>Note:**Contact groups do not work when editing shared contacts of your domain!</font>**
