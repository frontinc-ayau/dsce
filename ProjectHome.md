The **primary goal** or **vision** is to provide an easy to use and well designed program to create, update, delete, and view shared contacts of your Google Apps Premier and Education Editions domain.  Despite its focus on shared contacts it can also be used to edit and view private contacts of a gmail account.

**Easy to use** means that a new user of the program should be able to perform the basic tasks right from the beginning without any special training or reading of hundreds of FAQ-, help- or user guide- pages.

**Well designed** means that the user interface is free of any kind of gadgetry that detracts from its main purpose but it is still able to deliver a well perceived user experience. This also includes that messages and explanations provided to the user through the program are written in a language that can be interpreted without being a computer scientist.
