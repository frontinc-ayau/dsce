# Open Issue #

## Choice between the editing of private and shared contacts ##

It needs to be decided, if the user without a _gmail.com_ account should have the choice whether he wants to edit private or shared contacts.

## What to do if the user is not a domain administrator ##

Should he get per default his private contacts? Should he be informed about not being able to edit shared contacts?...
